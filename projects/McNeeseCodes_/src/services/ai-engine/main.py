#
# Request — tolerates BOTH the legacy intake form (severity:str) and the new
# /triage page (severity:int NRS, age_group). Pydantic `extra=ignore` so any
# future caller field is silently dropped instead of producing 422.
#
# Response — superset of the legacy AIAnalysis. Adds:
#   - urgency_reason       (1-line clinician-facing rationale)
#   - extracted_symptoms   (clinical entities surfaced from the narrative)
#   - negations            (entities the patient explicitly denies)
#   - rag_evidence         (verbatim guideline text chosen BEFORE the LLM)
#   - rag_source           (citation for the guideline above)
#   - recommended_route    (single-line care coordinator action)
#   - fhir_output          (CarePlan-shaped JSON, R4-compatible)
#
# All legacy fields are still present so the rest of the platform (front desk,
# nurse, provider, ops) keeps working unchanged.

# ======================================================================
#
# This is the agentic layer on top of the deterministic cascade. The agent
# is given a clinical tool surface (see agent_tools.py) and decides which
# tool to call in what order until it commits to an urgency verdict. The
# full reasoning trace is returned so the UI can render a step-by-step
# timeline of "what the agent did".
#
# Contract is intentionally narrow so the BFF and UI can render it without
# guessing. Always returns 200 with a structured response, even on internal
# failure (the response then carries agent_available=false).
